IF we don't lose anything on behaving good to someone then there is no reason not to. If this makes someone happy, you'd want to make someone happy since because of someone else, you have been happy. Thus happiness is passed.

-> There might be some who don't get much affected much when someone says bad to him but they are rare and they might conclude two things.

1. The speaker is a bit ill because he hasn't thought of this before or his fundamentals don't teach him how to behave right.

2. There must be a reason behind the behaviour let's try to find this out.

Out of the above two most people consider the first truth.
