Linear Interpolation - The Usual Stuff

Quadratic interpolation - 3 points needed

Assuming:

f(x) = b0 + b1(x-x0) + b2(x-x0)(x-x1)			- 1
Here bo, b1 and b2 are unknowns related to x0,y0,etc.

Strategy is that putting x = x0 in 1 give b0 = y0, putting x1 will give relation for b1 and finally b2 using x2

b1 = (f(x1)-f(x2))/(x-x1)
etc.
