Where is the Server?

I will provide it username and password somehow

It returns access control key (TELLS PERMISSIONS)

---------------------------------------------------------

Active Directory provided by Domain Controllers

I can go to any of these domain controller servers and give it my creds and get access control key


Samba server works like these domain controllers
