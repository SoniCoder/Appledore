*  In unordered graph –loop counted twice & every other edge once 

Min<Max> degree – delta<Capital>(G)

Sum of degrees of vertices is even

This implies number of odd vertices is even vodd + veven + vodd +...... vodd = 2X => Sig(vodd) = Even which is possible only if all v's are paired.

Bipartite Graphs - Vertices partitioned into two categories. In each category, no two vertices are related. [Theorem] A simple graph is bipartite iffit is possible to assign one of two different colors to each vertex so that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color.
