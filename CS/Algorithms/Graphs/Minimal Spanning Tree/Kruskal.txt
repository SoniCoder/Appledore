For: Undirected Weighted Graph

Does: Outputs a spanning tree with minimum total weight of edges. 

Requires: Disjoint Set DS

How to:

1. Make disjoint sets for all nodes.
2. Sort all edges.
3. One by one, inspect each edge and see if the two vertices are in same set.
4. If they are, then ignore otherwise store that edge and do makeunion on the two sets.



Space Complexity

O(E + V) - Storing Edges and Disjoint sets

Time Complexity

O(ElogE) - Mostly comes from sorting edges
