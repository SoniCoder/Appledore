For:    Directed Graph

Does:   Detects any cycle

How to:

Upon running DFS from any node, mark those which are being explored.
i.e. As soon as you start exploring a node mark it and only unmark it after no more children are left to explore.


Now while exploring any node, if you find any marked node then it means a cycle is present.

This works because if a node is marked, it means it's children or grandchildren, etc. are still being explored.

Complexities: Same as DFS
