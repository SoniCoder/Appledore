For: Directed Connected Graph with Arbitrary Weights

Does: Finds minimum weight hamiltonian cycle

How to:

Consider only 4 nodes.

1 2 3 4

Now lets look at the problem this way considering start vertex 1 -

min(1 to {2, 3, 4} via 2,3,4 to 1)

1 to {2, 3, 4} via 2 = min(1 to {2, 3} via 2,3 to 2)
1 to {2,3} via 2 = min(1 to {3} via 3 to 2) = dist(1,3) + dist(3,2)

Time complexity:

O(2^n * n^2)

2^n because exponential subsets.
For each subset we check maintain n copies for storing last visited node.
Each of these copies require n comparisons for finding minimum of its corresponding subproblem.

Space Complexity will also be similar - O(2^n * n) i.e. all copies of subsets
