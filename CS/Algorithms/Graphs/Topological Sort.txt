For: Acyclic - Directed Graphs

Does: Ordering everynode as per the directed Graphs

Required DS - 1x Set 1x Stack
->Set for Marking Nodes as Visited
->Stack will contain the ordering

Brief Algo:
Keep exploring from any node (DFS type) and add a particular node to the stack only when it has no more unexplored nodes in it.
After finishing exploring a node, mark it as visited.

Space and Time Complexity

O(V + E) - Doing DFS like traversing mostly
