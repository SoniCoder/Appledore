For: Undirected Graph

Does: Detects Articulation Points

Terminology:

1. Articulation Point: Removing this point disconnects the Graph

Required: 1x Set for marking nodes visited, DFS

How to:

1. Start with any vertex, call it root.
2. Maintain two values for each node - i. Visited Time ii. Low Time
3. For root, these are 0/0
4. Start DFS from root and increase visited time by 1 as you go deeper.
5. Also if no low time has been set, keep it same as visited time.
6. If a node finds a neighbour which has lower visited time than itself (except its parent),
give that node the same low time as the found node.
7. Once a parent finishes exploring a child, check whether its visited time is less than the child's low time.
8. If yes, then that parent node is an articulation point.
9. Finally to check the root node, whether it's A.P. check whether its child subgraphs are connected or not.

Complexities: Same as DFS
