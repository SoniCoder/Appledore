Algorithm Name: Ford Fulkerson - Edmonds Karp

For: Directed Weighted Graph / Pipeline Network with given capacities of pipes

Does: Finds maximum possible flow from source vertex to destination vertex as per given capacities.

Requires: BFS related DS on the graph

How to:

Consider graph with vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, G with source vertex A and destination vertex G

Running BFS will make us meet G. 
We can inspect the edges we encountered in the path and see which one has the least remaining capacity.
Add this capacity to maxflow and reduce residual capacities in the path by this amount.
Also increase residual capacities for backward edges by this amount as well.

Terminology:

Capacity - Max amount of flow that can occur in a pipe if it was empty initially.

Residual Capacity - Flow that can be added to current flow so it can achieve the max flow.

Time Complexity:

Using BFS - O(E^2 * V)

Space Complexity:

O(V+E) - For BFS
