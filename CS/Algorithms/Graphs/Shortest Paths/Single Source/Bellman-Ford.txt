For: Directed Graph with Arbitrary Edges

Does: Minimum Distances to all vertices from single source and also detects negative weight cycle 

Required: Distance List (Initialized to infinity)

How to:

-> Initialize distance list to infinity except for src vertex where value is 0.

Consider graph like this -


1 _ 2 _ 3
|   |
4   5
    |
    6

1. For every edge x -> y
2. Relax 1 -> y using 1 -> y > 1 -> x + x -> y.

Reason it works is because using it once connects 1 and all nodes that are 1 edge apart.
Using once more will connect nodes 2 edges apart.

Since max edges will be n - 1 we need to repeat it n - 1 times.

If upon repeating once more reduces any of the distances, a negative weight cycle is detected.

Space Complexity - O(V + E)

Time Complexity - O(E * V)
