For: Given Matrices to Multiply

Does: Finds optimal order to multiply that requires least number of calculations

How to:

Consider product of 4 Matrices


  0     1     2     3
  A     B     C     D
[1,2] [2,4] [4,6] [6,3]


Let our DP be DP[x,y] which will store minimum operations required to multiply matrices from x upto and including y

So we want, DP[0, 3]
Now last multiplication could have been 0-1 & 2-3
So we have breaking point at x, x+1 where x can be 0, 1, 2
Our answer will be the minimum of these these breaking points

So DP[0, 3] = min(DP[0, 0] + DP[1,3] + Multiply Cost for the result, DP[0, 1] + DP[2, 3]..... and so on

NOTE: Also store the breaking points to get final order

     0 1 2 3
0    0 ? ? ?
1      0 ? ?
2        0 ?
3          0


First calculate DP[x, y] where y-x = 1 using breaking point at x

When y-x = 2, 2 breaking possible at x and x+1 and you will have DP[x,x+1] & DP[x+2, y] because you will calculate them first.
