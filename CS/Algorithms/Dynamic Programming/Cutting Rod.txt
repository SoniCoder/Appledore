For: Given rod length and prices of various segments which can be solved

Does: Finds optimum way to cut the rod to maximize profit

How to:

Example:

Rod Length = 5

Length  Cost
1       2
2       5
3       7
4       8

2 Ways to do it

Way 1:

Include varieties one by one.
Every new variety you can check whether to cut with the new variety or not.

    0  1  2  3  4  5
1   0  2  4  6  8  10
2   0  2  5  
3   0
4   0


Way 2:

Initialize Price List to 0 for all lengths 0 to n

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now fill these for lengths given.

[0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 0]

Start from left, cut using all possibilities(varieties) and find the max one and store it
Keep doing it for higher and higher n.
