For: Denominations and a total Target

Does: Outputs distinct ways of making the target using infinite multiples of given Denominations

How to:

Coins - 2 3 
Target - 5

Consider you have no Denominations available

        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Ways = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now you have denominations of 2 

        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Ways = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

i.e. Ways[x] += Ways[x-2] for x >= 2

Now you get 5 as well

        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Ways = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
