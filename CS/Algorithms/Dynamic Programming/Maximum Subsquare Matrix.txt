For: Given matrix with 0s and Xs

Does: Finds the largest square where all sides are made up of Xs

How to:

Take this example:

0  X  X  X
0  X  0  X
X  X  X  X
0  X  X  X

Our Strategy will be first collect consecutive accumulated values of Xs for each cell for both top and left directions.

After that we can check each cell easily for how big square can we make if we choose it as bottom right corner of the square.

To get accumulated value its simply

If Mat[i][j] == 'X':
    DP[i][j] = (DP[i-1][j] + 1, DP[i][j-1] + 1)
