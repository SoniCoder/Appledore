For: Container Capacity, Given items with weights and values

Does: Finds maximum total value if an item can be either put or not put

How to:

Lets say Capacity (W) = 7

Weights = 1, 3, 4, 5
Values  = 1, 4, 5, 7


Start without any item and fill up W_i for 0 to W


    Ws  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
Items

        0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
+1      0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
+3      0  1  1  4  5  5  5  5

and so on

So DP[item][w_i] = max(DP[item-1][w_i], val[item] + DP[item-1][w_i-weight[item]])
