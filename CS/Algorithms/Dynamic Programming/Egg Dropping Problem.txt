For: Give a number of floors, and some eggs to work with.

Does: Outputs a minimum number of attempts you must do to find at which floor exactly egg starts to break

How to:

Consider 4 floors and 2 eggs.
With one egg, attempts will be the floor count
Now, if egg count > floors, the extra egg doesnt help as using one egg reduces number of floors by atleast 1.
So we will never need eggs more than floor count. So in this case, just call DP[eggs-1, floor]

Now lets say we got 2 eggs and 2 floors
Now our answer will be min of (attempts by dropping first egg from floor 1, attempts by dropping first egg from floor 2)
Now if we drop egg from floor 1... If it breaks we are left with 1-1 = 0 floors, this we used only one attempt
It it doesnt break we are left with 2-1 floors and 2-0 eggs and we know DP[2, 1] = 1. So in worst case we will need 2 attempts if we drop from floor 1

Similarly we will get for dropping it from 2. We take min of them and that will be the answer.

Floor 1 2

We can drop egg from floor 1

2   0  1  2  2  3
