For: Sequence with total ordering

Does: Finds maximum length subsequence in order

How to:

Take:

        3  4 -1  0  6  2  3

Consider them one by one, like only 3 and then involve 4 etc.

3       1  1  1  1  1  1  1
3+4     1  2  1  1  1  1  1
+ -1    1  2  1  1  1  1  1
+ 0     1  2  1  2  1  1  1
+ 6     1  2  1  2  2  1  1
                    3  1  1
+ 2                    3  1
+ 3                       4

Complexity -  O(n^2)
