For: Given a total amount you have to make and a number of denominationsof infinite quantities

Does: Outputs what amount of what denominations you should use to minimize coins required

How to:

Reverse of Cutting Rod Problem

You have to minimize using previous data this tiem.

We have 2 ways -
1. Include denominations one by one.
2. Consider all denominations at once and increase n one by one

Initially we have infinite ways of making everything except 0


0 inf inf inf inf inf

Lets say we got denomination = 1

Now, current min coins = min(prevcoins, 1+mincoints(total-denomination)

Keep doing it for every value of n from 1 to N and include more denominations once you are finished with one.

Way 2 - is to consider all denomination while making a value like n.

So mincoins = min(currentmin, 1+mincoins[n-denom1], 1+mincoins[n-denom2]), etc.
