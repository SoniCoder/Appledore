Objects

Properties - Belong to the objects
Any procedure would need to operate on these properties. These properties may change.

Methods - A procedure or a sequence of steps that uses the object's properties to produce something new. They can be also viewed as implementation of interfaces(dependent on scope i.e. where you are interfacing from).
