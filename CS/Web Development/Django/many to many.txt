Ways of querying using the foreign key as filter

Intermediary Models

class A(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)

class B(models.Model):
    a = models.ManyToManyField(A, through='C')
    ...

class C(models.Model):
    a = models.ForeignKey(A)
    b = models.ForeignKey(B)


Use related_name whenever multiple ManyToMany fields follow the same model

types = models.ManyToManyField('RelationshipType', blank=True,
                                   related_name='contact_relationships')

But this requires the referred field to be asymmetrical

contacts = models.ManyToManyField('self', through='ContactRelationship',
                                      symmetrical=False)
