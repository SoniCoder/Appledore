Common interface for containers
size(), Copy Constructor, clear(), swap(cont)

I. Sequence

 1. vector - Grows in single direction
 Methods:
 size()
 push_back()
 
 2. deque (Like a Deck) - Grows in both directions
 Methods:
 push_front()
 push_back()
 
 3. list - Doubly linked list implementation
 Methods:
 push_back()
 push_front()
 list.insert(itr, 8)
 list.erase(itr)
 mylist1.splice(itr, mylist2, itra, itrb)
 
 
II. Associative container - always sorted 
 1. set - (BST - AVL implementation i think) No Duplicates!
 Methods:
 insert - log time - returns pair<iterator, bool> - pair.first
 insert(itr, 9) - where itr is the hint
 find - log time
 erase(val/itr)
 
 * set seems good for keeping sorted array as numbers are coming and going
 
 2. multiset - same as set but redundant vals allowed
 * dereference to iterators are read-only
 
 3. map
